Notes for Operating our game:

1) Multi-Byte string are not allowed to be entered as the username or password
2) We accidentally did most of our work in phase 1 directory and only rebased our project few days
before the due date :(
3) When using the in game purchase feature, it requires credit card information. Since I do not have
access to banking information, user does not have to put in actual credits information. A mock card,
with same format as real one will do.
