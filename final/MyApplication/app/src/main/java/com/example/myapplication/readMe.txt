Notes for Operating our game:

1) Multi-Byte string are not allowed to be entered as the username or password

2) We accidentally did most of our work in phase 1 directory and only rebased our project few days
before the due date :(

3) When using the in game purchase feature, it requires credit card information. Since I do not have
access to banking information, user does not have to put in actual credits information. A mock card,
with same format as real one will do.

4) Only alphanumeric characters are allowed for username and passwords.

5) All file in our program is formatted using Google Format
